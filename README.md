### Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Spring Data JPA for effective data management in Java applications. 
Spring Data JPA simplifies the implementation of data access layers by reducing the amount of boilerplate code required. 
Specifically, this project explores the capabilities of the JpaRepository interface, which extends the CrudRepository interface and provides additional JPA-specific functionality.
